Project 2 COMS 352 README - completed alone by Nicholas Kokott (kokottni)

For this project I was asked to write and develop a RSFS file system
on any machine that runs c natively. I implemented an open, close, delete,
write, cut, append, and fseek function. From what I can tell they are all 
working properly and have full functionality during the isolated tests.

The only file that was modifed was the api.c file as the others were included
for me and did not require modification for the implementation that I utilized.
I filled out all of the functions that were there to be filled, which I listed above.
They are all working have comments to show what is happening and do what they
are supposed to do. There were some functions that I never made an explicit
inode struct that held the used inode as I just didnt see the point to restore that data.
